This game is a set of minigames with the purpose of helping the patient and accompanying the patient throughout the hand rehabilitation, from the initial phase until the end of the rehabilitation.

At the start of the game you will see a screen with the image of the game and two buttons: play and quit.
There are two modes of navigation with the hand using the leapmotion and with the mouse. Hand navigation requires using the right hand, placing the hand with the palm orthogonal to the horizontal plane, and moving with the rotation of the hand to the right or left, then returning to the initial position. To start the game, the palm must be facing the ground and lower the index finger that acts as a command. To exit the game, the hand must be rotated so that the palm faces upwards.

In the mouse mode, you must click on the top part above the play and move the mouse to the right or to the left, as there is an invisible slider underneath. To start the game just press on the play button, to exit instead press on quit.

Within each game, there is a menu with the three modes (easy, medium, hard), two buttons, instruction and quit, where the first explains how the game works the second instead takes you back to the start menu.

During the game we have put the pause mode that is activated whenever it does not detect the hand, and this allows you to take breaks if the patient is tired or to increase sensitivity if the game is too difficult for the user. It is also possible to set the volume during the game or exit directly and return to the home menu.

Depending on the game, there is a limitation in which the user must have his hand, in order for the patient to perform the required movement during rehabilitation.  If within the game the person puts their hand in a different position the game will not read these commands even if they were correct.

At the end there is a feedback to know how many correct and wrong movements there were during the game with also the sensitivity used. The sensitivity and the high score are saved. 

N.B. the game has been thought for a person who has problems with the right hand having the left hand healthy, for this reason we have made the games work only with the right hand.

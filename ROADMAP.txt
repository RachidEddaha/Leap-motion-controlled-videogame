ROADMAP
-------

This file contains the ideas for the future development and enhancement of the system


NEW GAMES
---------
Development of new games for more hand movements rehabilitation. Namely:

- Finger abduction / adduction
- Wrist supination / pronation
- Finger opposition
- Wrist ulnar / radial deviation

SUPPORT STRUCTURE
-----------------
Project of a suitable structure for upper limb and leap motion controller support. The structure will ensure the correct relative position between the hand and the leap motion with a consequent improvement of the correctness of the exercise and improvemente of the reading of the movements by the leap motion.

FEEDBACKS FOR THE OPERATOR
--------------------------
The system has been developed so to provide feedbacks about the number of correct movements of the patients and the sensibility. In order to improve the system feedbacks should be given in a more specific way to the operator. The following are possible solutions:

- Reading of the tremble of the patients during the exercise and providing the measurment in the end.

- Table containing the percentage of sensibility (as it is already calculated by the actual system) and the range of motion of patient's hand. This would provide a numeric measurement of the sensibility.

MECHANICAL GLOVE
----------------
Project of a motorised glove for passive rehabilitation. The glove would be worn by the unhealthy hand while the healthy hand would provide the inputs of the leap motion controller. This solution will make it possible to reach also patients with very reduced hand mobility.
The fingers would be opened by wire transmissions commanded by a rotative motor. The motor would be controlled by the signals coming from the leap motion controller and the signals would be generated by the healthy hand.
